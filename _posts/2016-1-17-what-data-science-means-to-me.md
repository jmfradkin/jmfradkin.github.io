After completing a grueling 4-year academic experience at Johns Hopkins balancing a major in Biomedical Engineering, a major in Applied Math & Statistics and a minor in Entreprenurship & Management, I was surprisingly uncertain of where I wanted to take my life upon graduation.  
Despite all the classes and labs required to earn a degree in Engineering, I really didn't know what to expect as I applied it in an industry setting. I was very excited to begin working at Medtronic in R&D, where I contributed to the development of a powered tissue stapler through various testing, data analysis, and documentation to help launch the product.
